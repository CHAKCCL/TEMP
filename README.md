SDK Platform Tools Release Notes: https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platforms.html

To download a manual version of SDK Tools, fill in the following url with a version from the above:

https://dl-ssl.google.com/android/repository/tools_r<version>-windows.zip
https://dl-ssl.google.com/android/repository/tools_r<version>-macosx.zip

For me downgrading to https://dl-ssl.google.com/android/repository/tools_r25.2.5-macosx.zip worked just fine. Once you download an older version the tools, just rename the tools directory at your Android SDK install and replace with the downloaded version.

I didn't need to downgrade Platform Tools, but if you need to, here are those links as well:

https://dl-ssl.google.com/android/repository/platform-tools_r<version>-windows.zip
https://dl-ssl.google.com/android/repository/platform-tools_r<version>-macosx.zip
